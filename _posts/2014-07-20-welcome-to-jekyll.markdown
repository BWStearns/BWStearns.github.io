One of those things that is both good and bad about beginning a new job search is that you end up doing all of those things that you know should be done incrimentally but just never got around to. For me one of these things is updating my personal site. I was putting it together last time I was looking for a job, but was hired before I got it even remotely decent looking.

This time I decided to go with Jekyll since it's nice and minimalist and my design taste can't ruin it too much. Additionally I used [json_resume](http://prat0318.github.io/json_resume/) to generate a [nice looking page](/), much thanks Prateek.

While I think it's fair to say that this site is unqeustionably more visually appealing than my old one, hopefully the things I want to build do get interrupted by a new job soon.
